    <h2>Kyrgyzstan Culture</h2>
    <img src="Images/culture.jpg" alt="culture-img">
    <p>Kyrgyzstan culture is heavily influenced by the traditions from nomadic
      life. Kyrgyz culture features influences from Russia, Persia, and Turkey,
      but yet remains something entirely unique. Nature influences are prominent,
      from the designs to the music, and many traditions reflect the fact that
      nomads lived closely with nature. Perhaps the most well known aspect of
      Kyrgyz culture is the Epic of Manas, an incredibly long poem passed down
      orally for generations.</p>

      <hr>

    <p>As nomads, the Kyrgyz people always lived closely with nature.
      From their housing to their clothing, everything was designed to adapt
      to changing weather and locations. Yurts are easy to take apart and carry,
      and can be made warmer for winter, and cooler for summer. The textiles
      inside of yurts, such as shyrdaks and tush kyiz (felt rugs and embroidered
      hangings), take their inspiration from designs found in nature, such as plants,
      animals, and landscapes. Even clothing was made out of natural materials, and
      designed to be comfortable while still stylish.</p>
